### Festival di Castrocaro
The Castrocaro music festival, also known as New voices’ contest is a festival that’s not to be missed. It is held every year in the city of Castrocaro Terme e Terra del Sole. The festival has a long history, it occured for the first time in 1957 and from then is one of the most loved music contest in Italy.

Castrocaro festival, especially in the 60’s and the 70’s, used to be an opportunity for lesser known singers who could have the chance to become enormously famous like Iva Zanicchi and Fiorella Mannoia to name but a few.

The festival is always brodcast on TV and on internet.

Nowaday the festival is losing much of its past television ratings. The style adopted is too old to catch the attention of the youngest and due to this it is slowly dying.

Yes, I do.  I listen very often to music while I’m studying. When I have to study subjects like mathematics or physics I can’t do it because it prevents me from thinking and I’m not able to do the math. With Italian literature or philosophy instead I’m used to listening to some music.

Fortunately I listen to a lot of electronic and instrumental music so I can’t be distracted by the lyrics of the song which is usually too invasive.

Over time I saw the effects of the music on my study: it helps me to concentrate and I am much less distracted by external inputs. It also allows me not to think about the passing of time therefore at the end of the day, I studied a lot and I got much less tired.lú

I’m convinced that music has a big influence on memory, music is great for memorizing lists of elements, dates of historical events to name but a few, the melody helps a lot to create easier phrases and sentences that you need to remember.

**Mood**. I am not influenced much by the music, I recognise its beauty and I appreciate good songs but they don’t really have a deep effect on my mood. I usually don’t listen to music when I’m sad but it’s quite rare. Playing an instrument is a very good method to calm yourself down.

**Memory**. I’m convinced that music has a big influence on memory. In my case it helps a lot to memorize long lists of names or date’s lists. It’s far easier to remember a song by heart than a school argument because of the melody and the rhythm

**Concentration**. Over time I saw the effects of the music on my study: it helps me to concentrate and I am much less distracted by external inputs. It also allows me not to think about the passing of time therefore at the end of the day, I studied a lot and I got much less tired.

**Language**. Listening to music can have positive feedback on the learning process of a specific language. It can get the brain used to some words or some expressions which become automatic in daily use.

**Art**. Music certainly is a form of art. Thereby music can influence other arts. It can be expressed through paintings or poetries. //art is quite generic

**Sports**. During sports many people listen to music to concentrate and to have a better performance.

I don’t have a real preference between live and recorded music. Recorded music on its side has the comfort, it is portable and storable on any device, you can choose every song ever whenever you are and whenever you want. Moreover recorded music often has a far better audio quality compared to the music of a concert.

On the other side live music is more involving, it includes many factors which can make the experience tremendously better than listening to music on your phone. The crowd, the stage makes a totally different atmosphere far more engaging.

Usually I listen to music alone. Without other people it is easier because you don’t have to tackle with music tastes of your friends. In addition I listen to music every time I’m bored; it really helps me to turn off the brain and think about anything. Instead listening to music with someone with same music taste of yours is really fun.

In the first photo we can see an enourmous concert, on the stage there is the dj and underneath him there is a huge crowd. The atmosphere is amazing, the concert seems to be fery fun, people are dancing and enjoying the music, moreover there is also a gorgeous sunset on the horizon.

In the second picture there is an indoor music show, it is certainly a more formal accasion compared to the concert and it would be attended by real music lovers. It seems to be quite boring for me and I would definetly go to the concert but I’m sure that people who are there are loving it, they’re smiling and clapping their hands and also the musician seems satisfied.
