## P.? Getting started
The thing that makes me happy the most is the awarness that I have nothing to do. The feeling of freedom from the daily schedule is one of the best feelings I could hope for. For this particular reason I love not to go to school, holidays are the culmination of resting. On the other hand I understand that in order to be that happy I have to spend much time doing something else. Onother thing that makes me incredibly happy is riding my bike in an empty road listening to music.
