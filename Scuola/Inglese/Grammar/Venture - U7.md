### P.76 es Getting Started

No I've never played any unusual sport or extreme one. I'm not really into extreme sports but I'd really like to try paragliding and parachuting. I enjoy a lot trekking and skiing because I love the mountain and for these reason I think that paragliding should be amazing. Everything that is up in air has an incredible attraction to me. Being able to see the landscapes from above and flying it's probably one of the best thing in the world.

Rugby. The rugby ball has an oval shape. A match is split into two 40-minute halves and each team has 15 players. The game is played on a field 94 meters long and 68 meters wide. Each game starts with a drop kick from the halfway line and the ball must travel 10 metres from the kick off. The teams have to touch the ground with the ball over the enemy baseline (it gives 5 point), if you score 5 points you have to kick the ball through the goal post and score other 2 points. To stop an enemy you are supposed to tackle him under the shoulders. You cannot pass forward the ball with the hands, to do that you must kick it. If you drop the ball forward or it comes out a line is a foul and there is a penality kick.

From my point of view sport, fitness and diet are enourmous factors for a healthy and balanced lifestyle.  
At first we know that with sport we can stay in shape, we can estabilishe new freindhsip and also learn how to work as a team if we choose a team sport. With more social interaction and some sport to play there are may possibility to be happier.

Beside the sport there should be also a balaced diet another essential factor in a healthy life (a diet is often made for one person because of different needs). A good diet is composed by carbs, vegetables and meet and healthy fat; the large part of fats that derive from fried dishes and animals are generally to avoid.

Finally I think that also some resting and relax have to be parts of the daily routine, with the right hours of sleep they are very important to restore the energy for the next day.

In coclusion to be healthy and happy is essential to do sport and to have the right diet.

I don't agree with it. Today a lot of teenagers do sport, lead a balanced life with a healthy diet. A lot of people try to keep fit and in shape doing some sport, there are a lot of teams of football, volleyball, basketball, athletics and more. Many people instead chose to go to the gym to train by themselves. About the diet I think that in Italy the average of people have a healthy diet. Without any doubt there is a small percentage of people that don't have any interest in sport activity but I wouldn't extend this habit to all the teenagers.
