**P.64 getting started**

I've never been in the USA but I want to visit them for a long time. The modern cities are surely one of the most attractive that I'd like to visit, the enormous architecturs and skycrapers are fascinating. I love the aspect of the caothic city such as New York City or Waschington DC. The second think that I'd love to visit are the National Parks in the US. There are many of them and they look beautiful. I find them breathtakung especially the Grand Canyon or the Yellowstone National Park. It would be great also visiting them in different seasons to see how do they change.

In my opinion when you're studing abroad, the main focuses are learning the language and learn the way of working of that place. For this reason leaving with a host family could be essential for the language learning, you could be in contanct with it every day. For the same reason is also important to attend a language class to improve your knowledge. Another very important activity is getting a job, as well as a great place to meet people this will allow you to become self-sufficient. Joining a sport club is a really goot way to introduce you in the school that you are attending.

1.  I think that having a foreign student living with my family and me would be a really dificult challenge. It really depends on which country doas the student come from, I think that an English student would be easier to host because of the language. Durng the first period of time it would be harder but after it I think that it would be a really interesting experience.
2.  Yes, I do. I think that the possibility to comunicate with the largest amount of people is one of the most important things that we could do. The other language to learn in this case would be English.
3.  I think that I would go to USA, Canada or New Zeland. I would definitely go to an English country to learn the language and I'm really curious about the school system of these country.
4.  I think Internet it's the most obvious option to learn about other countries. There are lots of documentaries and all the informations about all the countries of the world. Than you can also read books or touristic guides.
5.  I know that in many other countries the school are deeply different than Italy. There are other classes structure, many of the studied subjects are often different and..

Nowadays, many people, especially young people, are leaving their country and moving to another countries. I think that leaving your own country could be an amazing experience but it isn't alway possible for everyone.

In my opinion the main reason that drives people to move o another country is the better demand for work. Young people who have not been able to find work in their own one decide to try in other countries.

In contrast, one of the problems could be speaking a new language. In fact especially if it's not English it could be very challenging during the first period to communicate.

Moreover there might be lots of cultural diferences that you have to get used to.

In conclusion I think that today moving abroad is has become a very normal thing and that to look for work you shouldn't limit it to your own country but always look outside as well.
