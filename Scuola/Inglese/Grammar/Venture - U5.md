### P.57 es.10 *_text_

We had booked four tickets for a flight to London. We went to the airport by car and we have been stuck in a traffic jam for hours. Luckily we had left very early. When we finally arrived to the airport we ran to the platform but the dress of my mum got stuck between the steps of the escalator. After a few minutes the dress was ripped but we were still in time for the flight. The flight went well but when we arrived in Barcelona, we got to know that one of our checked luggage got lost. This problem made us spend a lot of time and because of it we missed our connection to Berlin.

I really enjoy travelling. My personal favourite type of transport is the car, I love road-trips and I find them really relaxing. On the other hand the car is one of the slowest transport and it's also one of the most dangerous. The underground is the most useful means of transport in a big city, it's fast and safe, with it you can avoid traffic jams and save much time. But not in all the cities there is one. I also love flying on the airplanes, the sight is fantastic and they are also the fastest way of travelling. The only bad things of airplane is that they are limited by the forecast and they burn lots of fuel creating pollution. The train is also a very useful type of transport, I use it especially for travels in Italy. The train is very useful to visit cities, the stations in fact are near the cities center unlike the airport. Unfortunately in Italy trains aren't the most efficient way to travel, they are often late and bad organized. The Finally the ferry, I don't really like it for long journey, I prefer it during brief periods because I suffer from seasickness and I always have to take pills to feel better. On the bright side the ferry permits to bring along the car

Lukily today is almost impossible to loose your ticket because it's always digital and we can keep it in our smartphones.

I'd really enjoy a round-the-world trip. I think it would be great visiting so many country and know different cultures. Id like to see amazing landscapes, I also know that it would be difficult to organize. I would travel by airplane and ferry because they're the safest way to travel and also the fastest one for very long journeys, but I would probably be scared to miss my connections or to loose mu luggage and It would be also very expensive. I would be also concerned about having a health accident; in many country in fact, is way easier to get sick and you have to be prepared with appropriate medicines. It's also important to pay attention to your document and your passport, if you loose them you couldn't travel anymore. Finally it could be difficult being far from home for a very long period of time.

In my opinion the mobile phone and the medical kit cant be replaced with anything, they are too difficult to find especially in hinospitable places. I think the easiest things to replace are the credit card and the hiking boots. The credit card easily replacable with cash money, they are often better in many country. The hiking boots can be replaced with some handmade boots or other type of shoes.

**Credit card**: the credit card can save your life sometimes, it is small and easy to carry and you can keep it in your wallet. With it you can buy everything in a easier way. But it could be a little useless in many country that accept only cash money.

**Medical kit:** it's essential in remote places where the first hospital is very far away, some bendages could save your life from some infections, in some country the water isnt drinkable and some antibiotics could be very useful against local deseas. If you are travelling through an area with poisoning animals, an antidote against them would be definitely useful.

**Driving licence:** it could be very useful to carry with you during a round-the world trip. Driving a car in fact could result foundamental if you want to move freely. You could also rent a car and to do it the licence is necessary

**Mobile phone:** I think it is one of the foundamental object to keep always with you. It's useful in case of emergency, with it you can fast call an ambulance or the police. With the mobile phone you can also keep in contact with your family that, in a round-the-world trip, will be very far away.

**Hiking boots:** they are foundamental if during your round-the-world trip you have to travel in hinospital places with a lot of unpaved roads or dirt ones. They could save you from a lot of pain to your feet.

1.  The place I would most like to visit in the world is Japan. I find that cities in Japan are gorgeous, the sky lines are always breath-taking. I also love the variety of landscapes and environment that you can find, from the green mountains to the high cliffs of the ocean.
2.  I think that I wouldn't like to visit North Korea. I think that I would'nt feel safe to walk around in a country like that. I'm sure that North Korea has beatiful places to visit but I put my personal safety before the experience.
3.  I think that travelling with friends will always be the perfect solution. Every experience is more enjoyable if you can share it with someone else. I find that with freinds also problems would be a lot easier to resolve.
4.  I think that before a long journey like that you should be prepared to all inconveniences that could show up during the travel. When you are young you don't have much experience in travelling for this reason I think it would be better wait until you are older.
5.  In my opinion travel can teach you a lot of things that you would have never made during a sedentary life in a city. You can learn about othe cultures, other religions, other life-style and habits that you probably didn't know existed. With travel your mind will be more open to other people.

1.  To avoid missing a flight, you can show up at the airport earlier.
2.  To check the car befor is a good idea beacouse it coud break down.
3.  When you get to an airport or a hotel, you have to check in if you want a room.
4.  If someone arrives at the departure too late, the airport's staff have to tell them that the time has run out.
5.  On the airplane you have to weare seat-belt during the take-off.
