The last year I was walking to the underground when suddently it started pouring. I decided to protect myself from the rain getting down the station. When I was down I noticed that the water was starting to come out the ceiling and was descending the stairs. I got in a train to change station but all of them was flooded except one. I managed to get out that situation. It has been really exciting.

5.  Yes I do. Seatbelts are essential and the can prevent a lot of deaths or injuries in car accidents. In fact there are many of them every day
