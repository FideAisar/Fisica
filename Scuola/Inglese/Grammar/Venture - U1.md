For me, that special person is **Marie Claire**. She’s 18, and she’s a student at Montpellier University, where she is studying English. We met years ago, when we were both f ve. She is very attractive, with lovely big brown eyes and beautiful long black hair, but the most wonderful thing about her is her sparkling personality. She is funny, smart and outgoing, and she has such a positive outlook on life. She’s interested in everybody, and lights up the lives of everyone she meets. More importantly, she’s always been a true friend. She’s very trustworthy and reliable and I know I can depend on her for anything. We get on really well together. In fact, we’ve never had an argument. Whatever happens, I’m sure we will always be close. Even if her life takes a different path from mine, I know we’ll always stay in touch. I feel amazingly lucky to know her.

### P.21 es 6

The strongest one

The person who influenced most my life is surely Jonah Lomu. When I started to play rugby I immediately heard his name. Jonah in fact, was a rugby player in New Zealand (which is famous to be the unbeatable national team) from 1992 to 2015 when he died. He has been famous because of his incredible strength and determination, for years he carried his team to win a lot of prizes.

He has been such an inspiration for every rugby player, he seemed unbreakable and the most incredible thing about him is that he was the youngest player to play in an international match with the New Zealand team and in that match he scored more points than any other player.

By the first time I saw him I understood that I wanted to be like him because looking at him everything seems possible.

Five years ago he died but everyone who loved him and I will never forget him and what he did.
