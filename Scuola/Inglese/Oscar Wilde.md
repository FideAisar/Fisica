# Oscar Wilde
Wilde claimed the independence of art from any sort of utilitarian or didactic function ('art for art sake'). Rejecting the 19th centuries social and moral codes, he loved to dress and behave eccentrically and to provoke his contemporaries.

Because he thought that art was not only an imitation of nature, he transformed his whole life in a form of art creating an inseparable link between his existence and art. He dealt with difficult themes like *corruption, sexuality, homoeroticism (Salomè)*. 
His comedies had a strong social critic against education, money, wealth, woman condition...

## The Picture of Dorian Gray
### Preface
In the preface Wilde provides readers with key points of the 19th-century aesthetic movement and his views on beauty, the roles of the artist and critic, and the interrelationships between them. He believes that artists (and writers) should create art not for their own fame but simply to display the beauty in the world. Critics—observers or readers—on the other hand should experience the beauty of the work without seeking to interpret or analyze it. People for whom Wilde believes "there is hope" are "the elect to whom beautiful things mean only beauty." Critics who attempt to "go beneath the surface" or to "read the symbol" of artworks "do so at their peril" because in doing so they may attribute meanings to the work that were not intended by the artist.

While artists can paint, sculpt, or write about virtue or vice, their works are neither moral nor immoral. A book, for example, is merely "well written, or badly written," and nothing more. This boils down to the ideas of "art for art's sake" and that art need not serve any practical or moral purpose—hence the concluding epigram, "All art is quite useless."
