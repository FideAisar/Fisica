# Rupert Brooke
In "The Soldier" Rupert Brooke celebrates the glory of dying for the homeland.  His idealistic view of the world is reflected in the first stanza in which he describes death through the use of a smooth image: dead bodies are compared to dust that enriches the foreign land. England is then personified as a generous life-generating mother who gifted "her flowers to love, her was to roam". 

In this poem we can trace back his patriotic enthusiasm.
