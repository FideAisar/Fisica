# Rupert Brooke
Rupert Brooke was born in Rugby in 1887. He started wirting in Cambridge where he produced numbers of popular poems mainly focused on the themes of love and nature, pseudo-pastoral view of the lacid landscape of rural England. Brooke achieved immediate acclaim with his war poetry. 

**The Soldier** is the concluding sonnet of Rupert Brooke's collection. It's been composed  during Christmas leave of the first part of the conflict. It offers an idealized view of the conflict as a noble adventure as well as an achievement of glory and immortality on the soldier part. Brooke uses a sonnet structure, unusual for a war poem but useful for the message Brooke wants to convey.

The first stanza focuses on the corpse of a dead soldier, his celebration of dying for the homeland and his idealistic view of the war is indeed reflected in the first stanza in which he describes death through the use of a smooth image: dead bodies are compared to dust that enriches the foreign land. Dead bodies and corpses become physical extensions of the motherland.
England is indeed personified in a generous life-generating mother who gifted, as it is written in the first stanza, "...her flowers to love, her ways to roam". 
The influence of his early poetic work is visible because of the idealized view of the world typical of pastoral-idylliac sonnets:"...flowers, .... rivers, .... suns". Brooke began his literary career writing love poem.

The second stanza move the attention to the soldier heart. Brooke celebrates the blissful state of those who die in battle.
