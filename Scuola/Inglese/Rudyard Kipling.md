# Rudyard Kipling
He was born in Mumbai in 1865. He was sent to England in order to receive a forma education at the age of 6. Not happy with his foster family he went back to India and worked as a journalist. In 1882 he went back to England as  a already affirmed writer. He has been the first English writer to be awarded the Nobel Price for Literature.

## Themes
- **Duty and responsibility:** Kipling genuinely believed in white man superiority and celebrated the civilisation as a moral duty. Bringing civilisation through war was considered a **responsibility** of western countries.  All of Kipling's works convey a message of responsibility, duty, endurance and fortitude, all qualities his characters embrace. In Kipling's novel is always emphasised that society needs dutiful people to function properly. 
- **India, England:** And since he did not belong to any country: he was a stranger both in India and England and America *he expressed an uncommon point of view on the matter*. Especially in his novel "Kim" he expresses his ideas about India: he thought that India could not govern itself (justifying English colonialism) but on the other hand he loved India's language, religious diversity and geographic diversity.

> Kipling's ideas were also supported by a new pseudo-science called **phrenology**. It claimed that the biological features like the shape of the skull of each group determined its social attributes. Europeans were considered clever, asian were melancholic, Native Americans prone to anger...

## Style
Kipling's fame was due mostly to his incredible ability of story-telling: his novels are characterised by short, concise and concrete sentences, by a vivid narration and playful language. Kipling had also a special gift in reproducing local dialects.

## The White Man's Burden
It was written as a response of the **Treaty of Paris, 1898** that placed the Spanish colonies of Cuba, Philippines, Puerto Rico and Guam under United States control. Kipling urged the USA to *take up the burden* as Britain and other European nation had done before. 

One of the main themes that we can focus on is the duality of **war** and **peace**. Even if they have opposite meaning, during colonialism and in Kipling's mind, peace is the consequence of war; in fact western country have to colonise uncivilised ones in order to bring peace.

**Man's risk:** It is described as a heavy difficult mission, a risky job.

### for each stanza
This task will require the best people in white society to go forth to another land, with an entire generation of young men essentially being exiled. These young men will be made to serve a foreign people they themselves conquered; paradoxically, the young men will have to serve their own unwilling captives

This duty will require patience, and restraint and all this will not be for the benefit of whites but for the benefit of those they rule.

The speaker lays out what will be the goals of the whites who go forth to conquest. They will constantly have to fight wars in order to maintain peace in the lands they rule, and these wars will be especially cruel.

 The whites will make the non-whites better by ruling them, but the non-whites will only respond with spite and blame, even when the whites protect them from worse enemies. The whites will be indulgent in a parental fashion toward the non-whites, who will cry out against their teachings.
 
 The speaker insists, the non-white peoples will see through the ruse. They will know instantly that the audience declined the challenge from exhaustion and fear, and they will judge them accordingly. If the task is declined, the non-white peoples will judge not just the whites themselves, but the things the whites hold dearest, including their religion and their tradition, as unworthy.

The speaker then encourages the audience to grow up and put childish ways behind them. This will let the audience refuse tasks that will get them easy praise. Instead, the white audience will have to prove themselves to be adults, even if this task offers little reward over the years.
