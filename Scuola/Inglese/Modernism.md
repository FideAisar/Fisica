# Modernism
In an era characterized by industrialization and by rhe global adoption of capitalism, rapid social change, and advances in science and the social sciences (e.g., Freudian theory), Modernists felt a growing alienation incompatible with Victorian morality, optimism, and convention. New ideas in psychology, philosophy, and political theory kindled a search for new modes of expression.

Modernism represents the break with the past and the concurrent search for new forms of expression. Modernism fostered a period of experimentation in the arts from the late 19th to the mid-20th century, particularly due to new feelings about reality in the years following World War I.

### victorian legacy
Victorian age witnessed the first forerunners of Modernism: with their ideas they were going against that Victorian and optimistic way of seeing reality.
1. Charles Darwin's scientific observations about evolution stated that human beings were the result of thousands of years of natural selection.
2. Friedric Nietzsche declared religion's death with his character Zarathustra's sentence "God is dead".
3. Marx also described the religion as the "opiate of the masses".

### Consciousness
The discovery of the unconscious was crucial for the development of modernist ideas.
The intellectual whose ideas most contributed to the development of the understanding human psyche was Sigmund Freud. He recognised the importance of the unconscious in human behaviour, he described the mind as an iceberg whose biggest part is hidden underneath the water.
The royal road to the unconscious, according to him, lies in the interpretation of dreams.
Freud also introduce innovative ideas about the centrality of sexuality in the human psyche.

### Time
The philosopher Henri Bergson revolutionized the concept of time describing it not as a linear series of units but as a costant flow. The German physicist Albert Einstein theorised that time coud no longer be regarded as an absolute  concept, it had to be independent depending of the perception of the ingle observer. Einstein introduced the notion on space-time continuum which connected the concepts of space and time forever.

# Modernist literature
Modernist authors attempted to investigate human nature in a modern world during gradual dissolution of all religious, social, ethical certainties. Modernist literature t of time describwas characterised by the tendency towards **experimentation** in narrative techniques, in the **workings of human consciousness** and a revolution of the **representation of time**.

The most important innovation in modern literacy was the stream of consciousness. Its aim was to render the free flux of thoughts a series of device such as:
1. Fragmentation of character's prospective
2. Breaking of syntactic and grammar rules
3. Overlapping of present and past events

The idea of stream of consciousness was the result of a series of important factors:
1. new conception of human consciousness by William James
2. theorisation of difference between objective and subjective time by Henri Bergson
