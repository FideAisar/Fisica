# Virginia Woolf
Virginia Woolf was born in London in 1882 in an upper-class family. She was raised in close contact with many artists and intellectuals in a creative ans intellectually stimulating environment. She drowned herself in 1841 due to her mental illness.

### Mrs Dalloway 
The events narrated in Mrs Dalloway enravel within the fram of one day in London: a Wednesday of June. The plot is not intended in a traditional way, the external events constitute the framework for the real main topics which are the characters' feelings, memoies and impressions.

**Life, London, this moment of June**: in the opening of the novel Clarissa Dalloway decides to leave her house to buy flowers for her party. The extract presents a description of the city filtered by the characters' consciousness. We meet Clarissa in the first sentence, in a proclamation of independence. She will get the flowers because Lucy has work to do. 

*flashback*
Here the author mediates an interior monologue through the flashback, she projects hersef in her house in in Burton; the flashback enter the page abruptly and the reader finds himself projected into a different time and place. Imagery at the beginning of this section  creates the feeling of jumping into a pool of water. Clarissa thinks of opening French doors and bursting into the fresh, morning air. The sea imagery arises again when Clarissa nears Big Ben. The bells which Big Ben ring break the hush that Clarissa feels before the bells are to ring. The effect of the bells is described as, "The leaden circles dissolve in the air." This image reminds one of water after a body has plunged into it.
In the flashback the figure of Peter Walsh is introduced as an eccentric person, we can say this from the sentence he is introduced with: "I prefer men to cauliflower".
  
*Scrope Purvis*
The point of view is always that of Clarissa, except  for a brief change in perspective, when we see her from the outside through the eyes of her neighbour, Scrope Purvis.

*setting*
The author introduces the setting of the events: London, Westminster. Woolf represents with London also the state of being Here Woolf gives to the environent an unique sense of solemnity with the use of specific tropes: boomed, irrevocable. Beside the solemnity transmitted by the bell the chaos of London is the second main focus of the writer that emphasises the duality of the city, which is both lively and cahotic. London even if containing countless lives, despite their physical proximity, rarely seem to truly touch. The lack of intimate conneciton  among the characters is the mirror of the disconnectedness of the city.


**Clarissa and Septimus**: Clarissa is at the flower shop when she hears a violent explosion coming from a motorcar. Passers-by gather around the vehicle fascinated by this mysterious presence involved in the accident. All faces become sober, everything come to a stand still. Clarissa and Septimus share this moment  of wonder and contemplation. Septimus overwhelmed by this source of anxiety feels like the world is about to burst in flames.

The accident changes the image of the city it was presented in the opening passage, were London was characterised by its dynamism and constant movement. Everyone sopped

Through the character of septimus Woolf portrays the traumatic effects of war on the psyche, she is indeed interested in psychoanalysism unconscious and function of human mind and she made a significan contribution to the spread of Freud's works in Britain. She was also haunted by the ghost of mental instabiliyt, desesase that will kill her.
