# Owen
Wilfred Owen was born in Shropshire in 1893. He attended the Reading University College and immersed himself in Romantic Poetry. In 1916 he fought in the Battle of the Somme in France where he witnessed the horrors of the trenches by which he had been traumatized.

**Dulce et decorum est**: Is a description of a gas attack and of the horrors lived by soldier in trenches. The poem aimed at dispelling the glorious figure of the soldier and the celebrated image of war promoted by the jingoistic verse. The structure is fragmented and makes the reader feel disoriented, it simulates the war environment. The structure in the oppossite of the one used by Brooke (a sonnet).

The speaking voice exposes all the dreadful details fo the brutality of war and the poem's intensity is based on a careful choice of language and tropes of the author.
In the first stanza Owen describes his company and him injured and almost deaf to the falling gas bombs; here we can read "Men marched asleep", a hyperbole used to give the sense of horror felt by soldier that were sentenced to death; Owen uses a lot o hyperboly, metphore and comparison in his poem; f.e.  "Drunk with fatigue".

The second stanza is the description of the gas disaster. Here Owen makes use of a marine metaphore and compares the dying suffocated by the gas to drowning in a green sea.

In the third one we can witness the effect of war on the author. By a post-trauma life introspection Owen describes his physical and psycological attitude toward the events he lived. He say that he can't get over the trauma of seeing his friend dying chocked by gas.

The fourth stanza concludes the poem writing directly to the reader. The use of "you" breakes the fourth wall and creates a strong connection with the reader. Owen describes his friend's terrible condition with a series of crude images: "His hanging face... ,the blood come gargling... ,bitter as the cud". The poem ends with the sentence declared as to be the old lie: Dulce et decorum est Pro patria mori; from Horace.
