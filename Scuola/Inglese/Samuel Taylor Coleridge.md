## Themes
### Supernatural
For Coleridge, the presence of supernatural in his poems, was crucial. He wanted to represent supernatural events in a credible way (instead Wordsworth represented ordinary life). To achieve this sensation Coleridge used what he called *suspension of disbelief*. Many of his poems have this sense of Mysterious and fantastic: in "The Ancient Mariner" we read about phantom ships...
### Imagination
Imagination allows the poet to perceive the unity of the universe. Coleridge make a distinction among three different kind of imagination:
1. Fancy: faculty of memory, store information and remember what happened.
2. Primary: unconscious process, every human being is triggered by the nature,
3. Secondary: is what coincides with *poetic imagination*, it refers to a conscious process through which you can reassemble the images taken with the primary imagination and create new symbols.

## Style
Coleridge poetry is characterised by a strong musicality and incantatory verses. Coleridge thought that every poem had to be adapted to what the meaning of it was. For this reason he make large use of symbolism, embodiments… His language is often archaic and he also uses onomatopeias and alliterations in order to give better results to his poems.


## The Rime of the Ancient Mariner
### Structure / Style
It is defined as a romantic ballad: like a medieval ballad it is written in four-line stanzas and in the form of a dialogue. Contrary to medieval ballads it has a mucah more deep psycological descriptions of the characters, it focuses more on the moral lesson and uses an extensive use of symbols.

### Themes
Relationship between man and nature: The Mariner kills the albatros for no reason because he doesn’t recognise the connection among every natural thing. Only after he recognised the beauty of the sea snakes he is forgiven.
