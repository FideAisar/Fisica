# Robert Louis Stevenson
Stevenson literary career was influenced by his interest in travel. His first novel was "An inland voyage", a story that recounted a trip he made in a canoe form Belgium to France. He thought that travelling was not only a pastime but a real non conformist way of life. The theme of travels became strictly linked with other social themes like the conditions of emigrants and the *negative sides of the American Dream*

Just from "The treasure Island" we can understand the second main theme Stevenson care about: **the myth of the double**. In The treasure island this characteristic is found in the main pirate, who is both a pirate, a source of threat and danger, and a father figure for the protagonist.

## The Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde
The extract recounts the encounter between Mr Hyde and Dr Lanyon. Dr Lanyon sees in Mr Hyde a devilish nature  but he is also fascinated by him. Mr Hyde produce conflicting feelings in Dr Lanyon. The entire extract revolves around the duality of Good and Evil, elements that can be seen in Dr Lanyon and Mr Hyde, rationality against irrationality in Dr Lanyon.

Dr Lanyon is a man of science and tells the story from his point of view. He describes Mr Hyde using objective and subjective adjectives: he was small with great apparent debility. He says that that man caused in him a disgustful curiosity

Stevenson writes this story with the purpose of deepening the complexity and ambiguity of human nature. Dr Jekyll is a Faustian characters whose ambition is to divide good and evil side of human soul with his experiments; his excess of ambition led him to destroy himself. Mr Hyde in the novel could be interpreted as:
- A suggestion to men to find a balance between good and evil in their life.
- The embodiment of the negative aspect of Victorian age: corruption, violence hidden behind the image of England as a progressive and civilised country. 

**Transformation:** The main event of the extract consists in the transformation of Mr Hyde that becomes Dr Jekyll after swallowing a potion. This event emphasises the most the devilish nature of Mr Hyde through detailed description of the transformation.
