# 2. Themes
## 2.1. Middle class hero
Crusoe insists on the fact that he is part of **the best social conditio** of that time. The middle clas was in fact between the *luxury* and the *absolute poverty*.
Moreover he has the ability to **exploit** everything he finds in order to improve his condition. He is capable of creating tools, he has **creativity, perseverance, intelligence.** *He makes good use of what the island offers him.*

<p style="text-align: center;padding-left: 2em; padding-right: 2em">  He manage to organise his life and little by little transform it in a little kingdom </p>

## 2.2. Colonial hero
Crusoe is the **perfect example of homo economicus**, he was shipwrecked on the island, he managed to create a farm and also to own a **slave**. 
Gradually, collecting goods, he create his own reign, it's not by chance that he refers to the island as:

<p style="text-align: center; padding-left: 2em; padding-right: 2em"> something to be dominated, exploited and civilised, the exact same principles the colonialism was based on.  </p>

His sense of superiority is due to his culture, his religion makes him thinks he is superior, his hard work, the fact that *he earned everything he owns* make him **morally superior**.

His behavior is highlighted during the meeting with the cannibals (he considers them brutes but at the same time he pities them *for them godless state.*), his behavior with **Friday** is the one of the **enlightened European man** who wants to civilise other populations. 

## 2.3. Religion
Defoe is a convinced Puritan dissenter and in Robinson Crusoe religion plays an important role. The protagonist is a **sinner**, he disobeyed his father and left his family, for this he is punished by God with several misadventures.
When he is on the desert island, the worst punishment for him is the solitude. 
Defoe wants to enphasise that:

<p style="text-align: center;padding-left: 2em; padding-right: 2em">  Crusoe became *rich and prosperous* only after a close relationship with the divine figure of God caused by the solitude. I nfact, the only one Crusoe could talk with was God.</p>
