     Wars of peace are conflicts moved against uncivilised populations occurred during colonialism. Western countries had to bring civilisation to the less enlightened population of the South and East through creul and brutal wars. For example maintaining peace and control under the colonies was considered Britain's responsibility
2. *How can this association be explained from Kipling's pov?*
