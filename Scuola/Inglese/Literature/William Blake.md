# William Blake
## Themes
**Figure of the child and the theme of childhood:***   Blake lived during a period of drastic changing: Industrial revolution, French and American Revolution. Due to all these events Blake became a harsh critic of his contemporary society wit strong libertarian ideas.  The ***child*** introduced in his collections “Songs of innocence” and “Songs of experience” is the symbol of the oppressed  and the embodiment of that state of innocence of those who live in purity.

***Hell and Heaven:***    Innocence and Experience become two opposite concepts but at the same time complementary state of human life.  Blake says that opposites must be accepted rather than fought because only contrast and opposition are able to bring progress.  At the same time Hell and Heaven are opposite but necessarily coexistent.

**Imagination:***   For Blake Imagination is the capacity to see beyond surface of reality and doing so, being able to penetrate the life of things more deeply.  Blake’s view is that Child knows more than an adult because he looks at the world with innocence and purity.
The poet has the function of warning against the evil, in fact Blake emphasise the important social role of the arts and their potential to change the world.

## The Lamb
*William Blake, Songs of Innocence (1789)*

1.   Little Lamb, who made thee?
2.   Dost thou know who made thee?
3.   Gave thee life, and bid thee feed
4.   By the stream and o'er the mead;
5.   Gave thee clothing of delight,
6.   Softest clothing, woolly, bright;
7.   Gave thee such a tender voice,
8.   Making all the vales rejoice!
9.   Little Lamb, who made thee?
10. Dost thou know who made thee?

The child who is supposed to be speaking to the lamb, gives a brief description of the little animal as he sees it: *The lamb has been blessed with life and with the capacity to feed by the stream and over the meadow; it has been endowed with bright and soft wool which serves as its clothing; it has a tender voice that fills the valley with joy.*
All the characteristics are positive, the colors are bright, everything recalls purity and harmony. 
The question (“who made thee?”) is a simple one, and yet the child is also tapping into the deep and timeless questions that all human beings have, about their own origins and the nature of creation.


11. Little Lamb, I'll tell thee,Little Lamb, 
12. I'll tell thee:He is called by thy name,
13. He is called by thy name,
14. For He calls Himself a Lamb.
15. He is meek, and He is mild;
16. He became a little child.
17. I a child, and thou a lamb,
18. We are called by His name.
19. Little Lamb, God bless thee!
20. Little Lamb, God bless thee!

The second stanza contains the answer to the previous stanza, in particular it focuses on the parallelism among the Creator, the Child and the Lamb.  Christ has another name, that is, Lamb, because Christ is meek and mild like lamb, Christ was also a child when he first appeared on this earth as the Son of God.

### Style
The numerous repetitions and rhymes make the text very musical and rhythmic, almost like a lullaby. The unsophisticated language and nursery rhyme qualities of the text recall innocence reinforcing the meaning of the poem.

### General
"The Lamb" is the counterpart poem to Blake's poem: "The Tyger" in Songs of Experience. In the poem Blake focuses on mediation on God’s presence in creation through the Lamb, a symbolic animal representing God.  Like many of Blake's works, the poem is about Christianity and the lamb is a frequently used name of Jesus Christ, who is also called "The Lamb of God”.
The Lamb is based on the insistent repetition of a rhetorical question and its answer at the beginning and end of the two stanzas. In these repetitions the main theme of poetry is expressed, the Creator and his goodness, which is manifested in the characteristics of the lamb.


## The Tyger

1.  Tyger! Tyger! Burning bright
2. In the forests of the night:
3.  What immortal hand or eye
4.  Could frame thy fearful symmetry?

William Blake attacks the Christian God as he asks whether a divine entity is capable of creating such a mesmerising creature with perfect definitions and extraordinary beauty. The sublime characteristic refers to an entity that is both big and powerful yet remains mysterious.


5.  In what distant deeps or skies
6.  Burnt the fire of thine eyes?
7.  On what wings dare he aspire?
8.  What the hand dare seize the fire?

The poet points ot that the creature reflects its creator. He creates a more supernatural image using the words ‘hand,’ ‘wings,’ and fire, relating to the divine being. Blake in these lines make an allusion to the classical myth of Icarus and Prometheus


9.  And what shoulder, and what art,
10. Could twist the sinews of thy heart?
11. And when thy heart began to beat,
12. What dread hand? And what dread feet?

The poet in this stanza, discusses the physical characteristics of the almighty creator, contemplating his various physical features.


13. What the hammer? What the chain?
14. In what furnace was thy brain?
15. What the anvil? What dread grasp
16. Dare its deadly terrors clasp?

An allegorical reference to a blacksmith is included in these lines. The hypothesis is that some intelligent creator was developing his creation as a blacksmith hammers and forms metal with considerable toil.


17. When the stars threw down their spears,
18. And water'd heaven with their tears:
19. Did He smile His work to see?
20. Did He who made the Lamb make thee?

The first line indicates the demotion of God’s arch-angel ‘Satan’ as a sign of rebellion against God’s will. Then he expresses the duality of the creator using the personification of the stars afraid of the new brighter creation: the tiger. Because of this they are “fallen”.


21. Tyger! Tyger! Burning bright
22. In the forests of the night:
23. What immortal hand or eye
24. Dare frame thy fearful symmetry?

The last stanza is the repetition of the first as a chorus. The word ‘could’ has been replaced by ‘dare’ by the poet. In this section, the poet attempts to question the creator’s ability. The poet tries to challenge God’s abilities in the final lines.


### Style
The poem flows with a rhythmic synchronisation (AABB) with a regular meter. The hammering is relevant to the blacksmith mentioned within the text.

### General
It, in essence, is a poem where the poet asks the tiger about its creator and his traits. Each stanza poses specific questions; The poem primarily questions the existence of God and his metaphysical attributes, referring to the tiger’s multiple corporeal characteristics as purely a work of art. The poet wonders how the creator would have felt after completing his creation. *Is he also the creator of the lamb?*
The poem create confusion  in the reader because he doesn’t specify what the God’s masterplan is, because it is unscrutable.



## London

1.  *I wander thro' each charter'd street,*
2.  *Near where the charter'd Thames does flow.*
3.  And mark in every face I meet*
4.  *Marks of weakness, marks of woe.*

The first stanza reveals that the speaker is walking down a street. It focuses on charter’d street, mark of industrialization and lack of freedom because everything is under the control of someone. The repetition wants to underline suffering and sense of anxiety and depression.


5.  In every cry of every Man,
6.  In every Infants cry of fear,
7.  In every voice: in every ban,
8.  The mind-forg'd manacles I hear

The second stanza gives some insight into the speaker’s melancholy feelings toward the people he watches pass him by. Also the mind is not free. The fact that these chains are “mind forg’d” reveals that they are metaphorical chains created by the people’s own ideas.


9.  How the Chimney-sweepers cry
10. Every blackning Church appalls,
11. And the hapless Soldiers sigh
12. Runs in blood down Palace walls

He implies that the shackles worn by the people and inflicted by society have some disastrous results. The lowest class were forced into this kind of work in order to provide for their families. 
He criticizes the church, calling it “blackning” and claiming that even the church “appalls” at the Chimney sweeper.
He also criticize the government by suggesting that the soldiers are the poor victims of a corrupt government.


13. But most thro' midnight streets I hear
14. How the youthful Harlots curse
15. Blasts the new-born Infants tear
16. And blights with plagues the Marriage hearse

In the final stanza, the speaker reveals how the corruptness of society attacks innocence. The idea of a youthful harlot suggests the level of poverty and corruption, that a girl would be involved in prostitution. She curses at the tears of a newborn baby.
The fact that he calls it a “marriage hearse” reveals that he views marriage as death.


### Style
It is divided in four quatrains which follow the ryme scheme ABAB. The third stanza is an acrostic, it spells the word “HEAR”.

### General
‘London’ by William Blake is a dark and dreary poem in which the speaker describes the difficulties of life in London through the structure of a walk. In ‘London,’ Blake engages with themes of urban life, childhood, and corruption. It’s clear from the first lines of the poem that Blake has a widely negative view of what it’s like to live and work in London, mostly due to the way the adult world destroys the innocence of childhood.
