For our series of articles"The Young and the Restless" we visited the exclusive home of Mr and Mrs Tom Buchanan in fashionable East Egg, Long Island. Their house is a red and white colonial mansion, tastefully decorated in every aspect: from the beach to the garden.
Tom is a rich man who plays polo; Daisy, his wife is Nick's second cousin. Miss baker is a famous golf player.
Before their life in New York Tom and Daisy travelled across the world and they stayed for few years in France.
Mr Buchanan's way of talking is characterised by strong opinions about race and black people. He thinks in fact that the white race is the one that must dominate over the black one. He also says that what he is talking about is not something that he thinks but he strongly believe that it is scientific approved.
The visit seemed to be enjoyable and interesting, It is always fun meeting strange people especially when they are that rich.

Dear Father,
I know that you told me that whenever I feel like criticising somebody I should remember that not everybody has had the advantages I have had. Well, my neighbour, Jay Gatsby, makes me wonder if your advice is always true.

Every weekend he gives incredible parties in order to meet Daisy, a girl he knew five years ago who is in love with.
