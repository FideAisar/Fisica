# Moby Dick
Ishmael, a young sailor, wants to experience whale hunting; he embarks on a ship called <i>Pequod. </i>The captain of the ship is the <b>Captain </b><b>Ahab</b>, a man with a false leg made out of a whale jaw. His leg had been ripped off by the legendary whale <b>Moby </b><b>Dick</b>.

During the voyage, towards Indian Ocean, the Pequod and the sailors captured several whales and drained all their oil that will be sold once they return home. In the meanwhile captain Ahab tries in every way to find and take revenge on the White Whale. The chiefmate <b>Sturbuck </b>tries to persuade Ahab to stop his useless search for the animal.

The pequod is also caught in a terrible storm, representing the power of nature like the one described by Coleridge in "The Ancient Mariner"; captain Ahab does not care of the storm and still wants to capture Moby Dick.

After crossing the equator Ahab sights the whale and tries to kill him with harpoons. Moby Dick and his incredible power manage to destroy them ad well as he did on the second day. On the third day he destroys the Pequod that sinks down the ocean. All the members of the crew are killed except Ishmael who is rescued by a whaling ship called <b>Rachel</b>.

## themes
The story of Moby Dick can be seen as an allegory of the <i><b>fight </b></i><i><b>between </b></i><i><b>good </b></i><i><b>and </b></i><i><b>evil</b></i>. Inspired by the works of S.T. Coleridge, Melville recounted the struggle of a sinful man (Ahab) who tries to kill the fearless Moby Dick only to prove his power. Ahab doesn't succeed in killing the whale and he is punished with death; for this reason another meaning of the story could be the <i><b>importance </b></i><i><b>of </b></i><i><b>respecting </b></i><i><b>God's </b></i><i><b>creatures. </b></i>In Samuel Taylor Coleridge the creatures were the slimy creatures swimming on the surface of the ocean, in Melville's work the creature is the whale. Another similarity is that like the Mariner also Ishmael survives the catastrophe in order to tell everybody the story.

## characters
- <b>Ahab: </b>he is described as a "god-like" and "ungodly" man. He is a courageous strong-willed man who wants to chose his destiny, a fearless explorer and traveller like Ulysses but the obsession of Moby Dick and of the desire of revenge are so overwhelming that he appears as a mentally ill person (in the novel he is described as monomaniac). The obsession is described through the expressions "frantic morbidness", "spiritual exasperation".
- <b>Moby </b><b>Dick: </b>the whale is described with ambivalent features; it is the symbol of evil and innocence. Captain Ahab thinks that he is devilish, cheaf mate Sturbuck instead thinks that he only follows his instinct when he attacks human. The whale has uncommon characteristics that make it easily distinguished by other sperm whales. It has a peculiar snow-white wrinkled forehead and a pyramidical white hump. All these unique traits reveal its identity at a long distance. The rest of its body was murbled white, streaked and spotted; for this reason it gained the name of  "The White Whale".

## style
Melville displays several stylistic choices:
- He uses <b>religious </b><b>sermons </b>style, <b>philosophical </b><b>essay.</b>
- He switches from a <b>lyrical </b><b>tone </b>to a more <b>tecnhnical </b><b>one</b>.
- He also switches from first and third person narration
