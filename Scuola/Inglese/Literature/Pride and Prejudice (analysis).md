## Writing
The author focuses on describing the social world around the English noble class. She highlights all the behaviours and the manners, the conventions of the society dominate the action of the story, and characters are differentiated by how they follow standards, or ideal of behaviour, established by societal conventions.
Austen uses the dialogue in order to describe characters personality to reveal their traits and attitudes: Austen uses the figure of Mrs Bennet continually to highlight the necessity of marriage for young women and he is oppposed by her husband who doesn't care much about it.
