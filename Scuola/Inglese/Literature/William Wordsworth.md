# William Wordsworth

## Themes
***Childhood***:    Childhood is that state of innocence and purity in which human being has the most powerful connection with Nature. Children in fact are who experience the most  intense bond with Nature; adulthood instead corrupted by social conventions.  Only a few of the adults keep that kind of connection with nature: poets, peasants, farmers.
***Memory and Imagination***: Memory is the ability to retrieve those joyous feelings of childhood. Memory, if reworked with imagination, can be used by poets to write verses capable of transmit real emotions.


## My heart leaps up when I behold
*William Wordsworth, Poems in Two Volumes (1807)*

1. My heart leaps up when I behold
2. A rainbow in the sky:
3. So was it when my life began;
4. So is it now I am a man;
5. So be it when I shall grow old,
6. Or let me die!
7. The Child is father of the Man;
8. And I could wish my days to be
9. Bound each to each by natural piety.

The poem deals with the intense connection between the poet and Nature, it describes how Nature shaped Wordsworth's childhood.  The intense joy and wonder felt by a child at the sight of a natural scenery pervades the poet whose heart still leaps up when he sees a rainbow.


## I wandered lonely as a cloud
*William Wordsworth, Poems in two volumes (1807)*

1. I wandered lonely as a cloud
2. That floats on high o'er vales and hills, 
3. When all at once I saw a crowd, 
4. A host, of golden daffodils;
5. Beside the lake, beneath the trees,
6. Fluttering and dancing in the breeze.

7. Continuous as the stars that shine
8. And twinkle on the milky way,
9. They stretched in never-ending line
10. Along the margin of a bay:
11. Ten thousand saw I at a glance,
12. Tossing their heads in sprightly dance.

13. The waves beside them danced; but they
14. Out-did the sparkling waves in glee:
15. A poet could not but be gay,
16. In such a jocund company:
17. I gazed—and gazed—but little thought
18. What wealth the show to me had brought:

19. For oft, when on my couch I lie
20. In vacant or in pensive mood,
21. They flash upon that inward eye
22. Which is the bliss of solitude;
23. And then my heart with pleasure fills,
24. And dances with the daffodils.

### General
The poet metaphorically compares him to a cloud for describing his thoughtless mental state on that day. Like a cloud, he was wandering in the valley aimlessly. The sudden spark that the daffodils gave to his creative spirit is expressed in this poem.
