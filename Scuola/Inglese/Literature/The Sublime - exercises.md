2. 
| Causes             | Effects             |
| ------------------ | ------------------- |
| Great and Sublime  | Major: Astonishment |
| Irresistible force | Minor: Admiration   |


3. The observer is not able to entertain any other object besides the one that is the reason of the astonishment. 
4. What can stimulate a sublime reaction is: serpents and poisonous animals, things of great dimensions like the ocean or greatly extended lands.
5. Distant things can be sublime because they are obscure and no one can form clear ideas about them: the night and its secrets are a great example of something that generates in us a sense of sublime.
6. Fear and passion are the things that most touch human emotions. Everything related to night that is unknown and causes fear in the human mind is an example. These two sources are so powerful on the human mind that they're the foundations of despotic governments.
7. Burke's conclusion is that the great and the sublime are more effective than the beautiful in art because they can transmit the sense of greatness and astonishment in a much stronger way.
