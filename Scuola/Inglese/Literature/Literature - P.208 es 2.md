### Compare Shakespeareâ€™s tragedies with the story of Nelson Mandela
Nelson Mandela lived by fighting the injustices that affect black men in South Africa, fighting to prove that there are no differences based on skin color. Also the characters in Shakespeare's tragedies fight their causes, Romeo and Juliet for their love, Hamlet to avenge his father, etc.

Nelson Mandela has a purely optimistic outlook on the future of his nation, on the contrary the same cannot be said of Romeo and Juliet. They have a pessimistic view that leads them to an unpleasant ending with their death.
