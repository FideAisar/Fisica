# Eliot
Thomas Stearns Eliot was born in St Louis, Missouri, in 1888. He attended Harvard University where he studied philosophy and the Sorbonne in Paris, where he attended Henry Bergson's lessons. After WW1 he took a job in London as a Bank clerk. Thanks to his masterpieces *Prufrock and Other Observations* and *The Waste Land* he gained himself an international reputation.

Eliot writes one of the first exaples of Modernist poem including themes like:
- Sterility of the modern world: he expresses disgust at humankind devoid of values and alienated, waiting for some sign of redemption. People are trapped in their monotonous, routine-like existence.

Stile: Eliot's poem appear as a mosaic of apparently disconnected fragments taken from various domains: everyday-life, literary quotation, mythological allusions...
These fragments are linked by association of ideas.

**The Love Song of J.Alfred Prufrock**: Eliot stages a drama of a modern cosciousness, Prufrock, who embodies the social paralysis analized by Eliot in several of his works. Prufrock is incapable of overcoming the social boundaries due to his lack of moral strenght and hi sterile existence. Even if he is aware of the futility of the world, he ends up by surrending to daily routine.

The poem is introduced by a quotation from Dante's Inferno. The choice of this specific epigraph suggests that Prufrock speaks from a sort of Hell embodied by the city where he live, London, but the Hell could also be hi inner world. Like Dante the reader deep dives in Prufrock's Hell.

Stanzas:
1. *Prufrock invites the interlocutor (himself) to a social engagement. They walk through a sordid, deserted area of a modern city, along the streets that only lead to a difficult question.*
   Here Eliot begins with a dark description of the ciity of London, we can feel Prufrock lonliness in a yet crowded city.
   
2. *Prufrock doesn't look forward to his social engagement and says there's no need to hurry. There will be time to put a mask and there will be time to postpone decisions.*
   Here we can see how Eliot moves from aspects of everyday life to higher thoughts concerning human exixtence. 
   
3. *He sees some women entering and leaving a room, chatting about Michelangelo.*
   
4. *Prufrock even if is well-dressed seems anxious and repeats there will be time for important decisions and changes of mind while people look at him and ridicule him behind his back.*
   He is ill-at-ease anf and feels he is judged. He feels uneasy with them because they do not add anything to his life, they make him feel as he is disturbing the universe. These people makes Prufroks' routine monototonous.

5. *Then he asks himself: why should he ask or answer any question? All things considered he already accomplished so much, he has een judged by cold, indifferent people, pinned like an insect.*
   He understands that his days are made up of inhautentic gestures, so why bother asking unpleasant questions?
   
6. *After all, he is not a prophet, he is just scared.*
   He comes to the conclusion that it is more confortable to put off any decision and go on with an apathetic life
