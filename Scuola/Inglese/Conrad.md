Conrad is considered the link between Victorian age and Modernism. His works contained themes and atmospheres which only became common in Europe two decades later and the audience was not fully prepared for them.

### Themes

1. Like most of Conrad's stories Hearth of Darkness reproduces a personal experience. Marlow's voyage on the river Congo is the outer trip symbolising the **inner trip** which leads the protagonist to self knowledge. The examples of literary topos are numerous: Homer, Dante... Interpretations could be several: it could be a moral journey which look into the nature of evil, ...
2. Conrad describes reality as a **hidden truth** that lies beneath the surface and is difficult to understand. These kind of ideas were spreading across Europe at the beginning of 20th century influenced by new discoveries in the field of psychoanalysis. 
   To Conrad each man focuses on everyday activities and worries that make reality fade; they are monkey tricks which distract us from the mystery of life ([[Pascal - 04 Divertissement]])
3. The **duality of men** is a central theme in Conrad's works. The theme of the double was typical of the late Victorian age and Conrad followed Stevenson's Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde when describing the human soul as a unity where two opposites co-exist  Conrad indeed made a step forward introducing along the theme of the double a psychological in-depth analysis that precedes Freud's psychoanalysis.  Marlow and Kurtz are the two faces of a single medal, they represent  opposite moral reactions to reality: self control and lack of restrain.

### Style
Conrad's style consists in a non-linear narration which includes several flashbacks and flashforwards, whole pages focus on a single moment of revelation while some long actions are completely omitted. He also puts a distance between truth and fiction by omitting details or names. This kind of **internal time** that characterise Conrad's narration would be used later by other authors like James Joyce and Virginia Woolf which tried to reproduce the so-called **stream of consciousness**.

Another important trait of Conrad's narration is the complexity of his language. He tends to use complex syntax and sophisticated vocabulary full of adjectives borrowing words from French and Polish. The language complexity and the extensive use of symbols result in a fascinating combinations of words perfectly blended. Conrad declared that the message of his books is just as disturbing as fascinating.
Because of the musicality of his works, his novels was called "prose poems".
