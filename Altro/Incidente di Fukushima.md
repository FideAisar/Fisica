# Incidente di Fukushima
## 1 United Nations Scientific Committee on the Effects of Atomic Radiation:

Capitolo VI: Assesment of doses to workers, paragrafo C: Summary
> In the years since the UNSCEAR 2013 Report [U10] no adverse health effects among Fukushima Prefecture residents have been documented that are directly attributable to radiation exposure from the FDNPS accident. There have been some modest changes in the Committee’s updated estimates of doses to members of the public compared with the Committee’s previous estimates (see chapter V). In addition, estimated baseline cancer risks have undergone a modest amount of change, and new data have become available to update estimates of radiation risk for various cancer endpoints. The Committee has therefore carried out reanalyses of lifetime risks for particularly radiosensitive malignancies: leukaemia, thyroid cancer and female breast cancer, as well as all solid cancers (excluding thyroid cancer and nonmelanoma skin cancer).

## 2 J-value assessment of relocation measures following the nuclear power plant accidents at Chernobyl and Fukushima Daiichi:

> Highlights
> - J-value has assessed population relocations after [Chernobyl](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/chernobyl "Learn more about Chernobyl from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") and Fukushima Daiichi.
> - Relocation was unjustified for 75% of the 335,000 people relocated after Chernobyl.
> - Relocation was unjustified for the 160,000 people relocated after Fukushima.
> - Loss of life expectancy is a simple but accurate way of conveying radiation risk.
> - The J-value builds on loss of life expectancy to provide objective guidance.
